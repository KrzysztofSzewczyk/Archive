# Archive
I have a few repositories that are archived, and I don't need them at the moment. Decided to store them there.
Every work here is licensed under MIT license. Projects are split by separate subdirectories. Projects here
are archived, and I'm not going to work on them anymore. But, there's slight chance for me to reopen a few projects...
